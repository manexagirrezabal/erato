it is epidemic and is pandemic
rather pandemic and epidemic
painting, pandemic, epidemics, law
by some pandemic epidemic inn

pandemic epidemic to my grave
the Wallenstein and shadow, moon and general
that ever epidemic did pandemic
a pandemic is a navy epidemic

out under the pandemic epidemic
no more epidemic, no more pandemic
epidemic pandemic, shed these braves
when the cold north epidemics pandemic

epidemic this pandemic is cold
so many general, so many general
