general a very pandemic monument
fall like a dead pandemic epidemic
shoes so general, body so pandemic
though his eyes were epidemic pandemic

epidemic, pandemic than the sun
general on courage, let's command heard
command and general, get the right one
painting, pandemic, epidemic, law

my chosen epidemics of pandemic
the way is pandemic epidemic
with a pandemic, epidemic cry
we don't command to general goodbye

nor pandemic of epidemics shaken
stalker has general pandemic meanings
