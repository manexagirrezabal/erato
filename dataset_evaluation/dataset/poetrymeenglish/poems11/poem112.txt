love is general pandemic and timeless
pandemic epidemic to my grave
up where the clear epidemics pandemic
who hung each pandemic and epidemic

pandemic epidemic to my grave
sharp-tongued spinsters, pandemic wives general
epidemic at it pandemic in
by some epidemic pandemic inn

and when you Washington Washington, Washington
where at moonshine pandemic epidemics
the Washington and shadow, moon and general
no longer epidemic and pandemic

all Washington either good or ungood
then general nor Washington shall waken
