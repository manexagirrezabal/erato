who hung each pandemic and epidemic
had your eyes epidemic pandemic
nor pandemic of epidemics shaken
then general nor Bradley shall waken

pandemic, epidemic, weird, outdriven
all around, the eruption epidemics
feed the epidemic in your pandemic
twin brothers, pandemic and epidemic

more general than pandemic of diamond
pandemic is a branch of epidemics
deep and meaningless general to me
pandemic epidemic all to see

epidemic pandemic to my grave
my chosen epidemics of pandemic
