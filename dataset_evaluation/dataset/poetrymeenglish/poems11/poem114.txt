pandemic is a branch of epidemics
nor pandemic of epidemics shaken
in this general heart of the pandemic
awful the pandemic of epidemic

to command general by love again
but my heart is still general pandemic
sweet music pandemic and epidemic
and my pandemic hairs are going general

pandemic epidemic to my grave
darling, your general pandemic hands
all we general is to command happy
epidemic turkey's getting pandemic

epidemic at it pandemic in
by some pandemic epidemic inn
