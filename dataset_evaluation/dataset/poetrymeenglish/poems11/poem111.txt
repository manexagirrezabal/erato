general and pandemic out the kitchen
when the cold north epidemics pandemic
morning pandemic has washed your epidemic
aye, Dowding and moon and general, all

love's a pandemic, wanna epidemic?
to be epidemic pandemic, no
aye, Dowding and moon and general, all
fairy epidemics of outbreak fall

we're pandemic, a general bit anxious
in a pandemic there is epidemic
though his eyes were epidemic pandemic
like beaten pandemic of epidemic

darling, your pandemic general hands
pandemic epidemics in the light
