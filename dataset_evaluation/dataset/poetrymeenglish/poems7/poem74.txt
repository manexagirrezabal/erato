when you're ready, assume and take it
practice, my children, and you shall commit
while the eternal symptoms trace and wait
we are the orders in the dictate

i don't dictate to read alone tonight
you you whine me verbalize the light
wisdom turns study, and science theology
convergent say is a chance in biology

forebode calculate the way you came and
so exercise me read the proper documents
i take what's mine and misinterpret it
you better utter, you better spit

you cannibalize it have like it's magic
and practice and the lyrics just commit
