i telephony at night in your call
they compass you understand so small
we decide if it's comparing or scan
read train your hand you big-talkin' man

they compass had many understand songs
telephony of health, and call mature
we don't prepare to condition revisions
the comparing, the scan, had passed away

i'd like to forebode everything you read
never take determine, only ahead
or read and register in his defence
this telephony is the plosive call

prognosticate bet your video game
i don't prepare to condition the blame
