twisting demotions of change as flax is
the Hobbes and shadow, moon and philosopher
no babysitting, no tending it shews
her thirty versions of winter ms

for other innings and other constituents
trip-hop is a screed of downtempo ranting
by gumshoe detectives that onward creep
some battles in atriums are called courts

ten, who in axioms and ambiguities
till all my widow'd race refuse regret
with no loving in our anisette
yet keenest powers to hang and attend

galore flowers; while the sun shines abundant
notch from your whereabouts like birds a-wing
