though his eyes were parochial provincial
hoses are also called handbook or guides
my life's final device... turns into feeder
to evil courses: feeder and birdfeeder

one arm found gracious among many armchairs
long drooping eyeballs, eyes like full-blown moons
licking fresh vessels, feel the agony's churn
happening disappearances in its turn

but dreadful accomplishment, dreadful sledding
review, revaluation and the sorcerer
beneath our writings, and long the reading
well, trolling, trolling, trolling, trolling, troll

it stores recorded soap or other bribes
in a sublime and elevated chamber
