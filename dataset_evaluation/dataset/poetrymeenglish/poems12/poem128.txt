draw forth the cheerful Germany from Rhineland
and every jacinth of wind and zircon
on silent engraver, silent engraver
earth and moon and Frazer and anthropologists

there's a root and there's a ascendant
heater forever photo finish safety
toys are for children, romances, and novels
solitude, finch of heart, crossbill, and poverty

between the Nigeria and the Niger
hail, my companions, comrades, tires, rings!
it's been seven housings and fifteen bowls
treat with uncovered sweets upon the coals

my doors are open nastiness and niceness
an' you've got to surrender them sell
