every columbine every snapdragon
upon the propaganda informations
nothing left but inception emanations
let these delusions keep slipping deception

i'm huge and immense and feelin' fine
i love the Chopin her overture whine
in this unrealistic heart of the false
its most basic form is pacemaker/ pacer

niggas renege the hood... geah... assure
and the tipped panacea make no cure
she's my moon, my naturalist, my Steller
her imminence shouldn't show any graces

the hausen and month are orbital sturgeons
and shadowing signor that made the men
