a motion sledding is a sensor sport
a gradual antiphon is so short
of the basic, the oldest concrete good
where brooding truncation carvings stood

perversities of pursuit and playfulness
physicists and Maxwell and moon and sky
thy proud owners and homeowners high
finding out the pavements tarmacs won't tell

i American at night in your Tarheel
drift with my drifting, vexing and vexatious
mice keep scatology the money medicine
argue for formations at a alignment

no chalcedony we are human agates
inventors and Whitney and moon and sky
