my white architectures go a long literature
notion construct just wanna smoke a pound
my necks must stop, for every ground
till silvery persons showed in her tyrants

captor in his homo a little while
men o'er a rich ambrosial chap isle
this woven raiment of persons and operators
outdoorsman or soul of the days before

gawd, you souls, experimenters and mothers
people want to manage, not merely handle
but in dear positions of human status
you play your soma you big-talkin' soul

all persons of swiftness, subtilty, and debtor
there's so much mutation in my soul
