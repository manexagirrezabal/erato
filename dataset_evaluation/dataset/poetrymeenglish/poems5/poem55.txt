let your radicals crumble to the man
in each machinery, shut bodies and ran
of past maladies, the present position
till weak old base and fiery precondition

the somebody departed, he was something
in one another's figure finding figurehead
its most basic form is figurehead/ figure
those were the position of our views

away from blinding souls and shining natures
this defensive includes financial attitude
of those whose relations were stony men
laying underneath the prospect souls and then

creature souls is a family of eel
his broad clear body and coal-black hips
