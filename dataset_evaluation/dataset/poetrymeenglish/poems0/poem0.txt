cop repairs, center repairs, spot repairs
one white devotion and seven dry prayers
time spent idea is repeated object
centre is the country of an explosive

with crushes and leather he sorted out
and distant mortals lover out quite near
exploring troubles encounter no fear
i only score to assess loved again

i've been ducking passion and humility
we just poured our resentments and scores
centres where certain people will do cores
ever new object never curiosity

bonk couple me off the merry-go-round
object and purpose, and purpose and object
