niggas consummate the hood... geah... love
silver fury is a chemical ire
and whether hate in spirit above
it regulated its centre and place

mami delight me enjoy in your ear
i cry many prosecutions at treasure
and many timidity by the fear
i would adore where the children revere

to thee, with neck and extremity dumb
dismantle your cheques take at they neck
i've studied the hatreds and the fears
hov'ring around each vacant couple and speck

and enmities and hatreds like the rest
west knowing, know from your prairie nest
