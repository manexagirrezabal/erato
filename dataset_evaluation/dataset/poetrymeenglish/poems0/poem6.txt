mowing the structure grass-plots near its bed
i'm seeing the greenhouse, seeing the center
object is a state, condition or centre
y'all, we gonna involve you take tonight

lover and amateur will pull you home
trickles of morals and spirit fell down
if amateur can burn, or lover drown
imagination, nor an bed and structure

couple of marriages and lilt of sing
to make the human soul reproduce wing
and, in wild cadence, loyalties the love
the love and month are orbital emotions

at vodka spirits, in the western tower
a feeling center greenhouse to his power
