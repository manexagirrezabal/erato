my alarms must stop, for every fear
it is centres ahead of the clear
happy observation, and mighty score
the score after, the pricing before

gotta mate your story sometimes, you bang
of vain lovers and travellers that failed?
love by love, benevolence by benevolence
phone descendents have taken all your mate

from the anxiety and the annoyances
anxiety and love depart in twain
her mighty brace with score, doth complain
have sun clear hypochondria anxieties

to realize what has audit to take
displace me centre your heart a break
