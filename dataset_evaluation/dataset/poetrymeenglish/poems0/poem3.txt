for all seemed abhorrence, hatred or woe
was it a hate or spirits ago
summer records and summer scores are gone
her objects and trifles will not forget

and rents and passions widen with emotionalism
old passions and dramas coloring it
amateurs are shrunk to lovers, and chains
you triumph over origin and centre!

who collected black objects and expressions
his body bent, his amateurs and lovers
around thine earth sun-wing√®d centers do midstream
lover! dart thy victims! in tepid streams

i've studied the dramas and the passions
can't distinguish afraid to know a fall
