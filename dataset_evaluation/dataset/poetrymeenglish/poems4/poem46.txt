below the computer, above the memories
she sings mostly compatible computer
and it grew both warrior and machine
telly or television could mean

up computer is a part of psychology
either in computer or thus in press
and moving memories in the computer
my expert, the observer of my love

keyboards of typewriters who'd never been
this store and museum we're living in
hello again, to all my incompatible
she sings mostly compatible computer

computer no predictors, say no names
a structure of distant platform that proclaims
