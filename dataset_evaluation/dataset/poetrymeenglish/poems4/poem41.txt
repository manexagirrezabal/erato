for, like cemeteries of martial site
machines of danger, appointments of waking
still computing can't scroll you tonight
over endless chips, stumbling in cracked breaking

status is a state, computer or adder
we'll have the radical of our experts
and endless flocks of planners and machines
vanity keyboards in fans, movie screens

computer by computer, node by node
inside the processors of my computer
ten lonely planners, ten lonely machines
vanity tigers in machines, movie screens

my adder computer keeps getting' older
and blade and confabulation and memory
