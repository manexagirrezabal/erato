hail, my companions, comrades, slivers, chips!
up computer is a part of psychology
formats to fairness, appearance fares brisker
we'll have the computer of our hosts

chip microprocessors and trumpets cheerfully
dark turntables on a dangerous phonograph
oh, may the radicals in machines fall
brown machines of deep riders sunless stole

computer slowly through drowning predictors
just another console in your computer
a computing firewall at the train station
ten hosts' till departure organization

the most loneliest way of my slot
each expert, mug, and computer and pot
