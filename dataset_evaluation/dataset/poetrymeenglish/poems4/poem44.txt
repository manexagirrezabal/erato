so don't become some assembly construction
his computer bent, his diskettes and knees
japan state machines are horse-drawn stamps
your computer of node, your mellow ease

chips or sulphur is a chemical murphy
but dreadful construction, dreadful assembly
hosts, unions, on their sodden faces, hurl'd
with their experts, portmanteaus, and faces

could never, or by keyboard or computer
by the wooden machines, with stealthy hooter
this woven raiment of snatchers and plotters
assemblies, mobilizations, and train

some servers' paws, some computer from scuts
a computer whose phonographs are long
