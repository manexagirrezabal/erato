triune motor circus at its machinery
by machinery and repeated motor
i cry many assemblies at computer
with all the computing in her router

mounting in hosts, mutation beyond death
mutation turns the old hosts to derision
but in dear clients of human computer
beneath the maples on the computing router

the computer is about four sex keyboards
your manly authorities shall machine
machines, women, on their sodden lives, hurl'd
innkeeper you with the host of mean

and overhead strange weathers press and advertise
when death shall close these computer pianos
