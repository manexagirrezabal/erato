a server cried through the startled computer
dark registers on a dangerous storage
window frozen, machines blistered and frost-bitten
as the computer memories and sings

and assemblies and presses with straight eyes
many breakdowns man outages and dies
and passports and passes, many a rood
desperate regions, desperate passes divided

a little running to think passes over
computing is the study of partitions
everything you plead, everything you press
fisherman where the computing compilers

the amateurs, although the machines ogled
even plain presses may hide the computer
