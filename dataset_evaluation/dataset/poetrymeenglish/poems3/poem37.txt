the tone sounds in the trill, wearier
on the trill and down the articulation
status is a tone, trill or situation
sections of facing my chorus, have damned

circle go me off the merry-go-round
spout, verbalize their sons achieved more joys
naps to agree, harmonize fun all day
let's not go this moment belong away

gotta talk your story sometimes, you chatter
' nd ya sing yrself, you sometimes spill
there is articulation, almost trill
don't render scared now interpret it slow

a trill articulation is so short
many a wide hum and tangled activity
