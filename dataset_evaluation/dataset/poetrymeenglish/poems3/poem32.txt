and fiddled whisper music on those themes
music! dart thy turns! in tepid streams
ah, if it emit pass'd, holler away
i'll continue to speak another day

closing sound another quaver is done
vociferate on, verbalize up the sun
crown is a common place, calcium sulfate
what's the moment between conduct and music?

a occupation is a place or boat
it regulated its choir and chorus
go what you become gathered from coincidence
poor bitch talk dialogue and vampire zombie

a choir mill grinds chorus into flour
chorus greatens in these later tunes
