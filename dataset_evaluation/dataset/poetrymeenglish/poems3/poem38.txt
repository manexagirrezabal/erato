a landmark is a large electric place
while the eternal dragons troll and wait
brand, sing up, babble into its grace
or some other mendacious whirl or go

solitude, spring of mouth, distress, and poverty
godless music, i transpose in myself
phone instances have taken all your break
border happy lovers render no part

but mouth of formation over a rock
from manifold juxtapositions, place
the chorus melodies of her embrace
mourning all chorus and mourning all melody

his broad clear place and coal-black surroundings
juxtapositions are a kind of place
