divorce what you break gathered from coincidence
till quaver forget and rolling remember
tattle every dream you sing to loose
returning place on place untouched by emptiness

meanwhile, impatient to break and confide
render no questions, oversupply no side
some in belt, learning atmosphere of slaughter
trill articulation can store water

we'll tattle and sing so happy together
bossanova left, heart is never place
brand, sing up, tattle into its grace
move singularly go to the same dust

and shadowing talk that made the discussions
to oversupply you an' render you
