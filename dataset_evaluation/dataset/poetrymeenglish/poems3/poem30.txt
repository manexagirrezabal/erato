belt is a ammunition found in mammals
i roll the sorrow troll another day
well the break collapses and you display
in my music, sounds are becoming clearer

i utter that you've bumble so far
music is the study of pyrotechnics
gotta discover love to see on living
but emerge it that they break afar

thy music is heard thro' rolling utterances
and silent, by the interjections' break
each ammunition, mug, and belt and pot
to babble up and sing another shot

how divers noises witness in each hum
don't chant me sing a motherfucking fool
