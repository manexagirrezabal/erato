they'd verbalize it the faster they'd yack
ballet come white, or chorus come black
i overexpose seen how you expose
and they expose me down to overexpose

for miserable graves that place with self
godless music, i orchestrate in myself
west break, hiatus from your prairie nest
and extend that same heaven render mercy

they overexpose me to expose like
a break is something that produces flight
still masonry can't render you tonight
to the place of the incumbency yeah

i'd like to speak everything you proceed
proceed and proceed and proceed we speak
