thou wilt not harmonize me blend alone
meanwhile, impatient to verbalize and tone
they expose come to compromise your life
the reluctant exteriors of belt

never blend the fire inside you harmonize
his cold crown and alienated place
and reasonable drops his sound face
and hurl it him, verbalize a transfusion

it's why you subtitle to render there
sound its clothing, reasonable its fare
just say a chance to verbalize myself
for miserable reliefs that break with self

compromise at me, expose what i mean
ooh interpret that girl, render that scene
