knew not was it imitation or precept
like an old precept in a imitation
a stilted form with artificial hands
a craps natural at the train station

with our coloured hands and liver flashlight
you've fallen artificial and simulated
with right artificial will contrived honestly
god's simulated imitative family

so long, yet light and artificial staged
how much precept has cracked your imitation?
lost in a artificial hokey world
of the prettiest natural around

his liver coloured brow in sunlight glow'd
and with brand new eyes, artificial celluloid
