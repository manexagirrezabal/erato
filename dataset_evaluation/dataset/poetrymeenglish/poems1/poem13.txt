and it is artificial and affected
o garment not artificial but hokey
a artificial sort of hokey love
the circuits of thine imitation teaching

stringy serpents with unreal stretching throats
our talk had been faux and artificial
so artificial contrived was its hue!
the teaching by imitation; the grass

but when it's artificial it's arranged
through all the imitation teaching have changed
a teaching imitation is so short
lost in a artificial hokey world

such the genial imitation and travesty
with our stringy hands and unreal flashlight
