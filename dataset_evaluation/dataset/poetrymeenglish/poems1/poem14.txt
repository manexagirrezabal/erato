charade is the study of imitation
in natural or artificial weather
burn'd like one imitation charade together
i carry the artificial and imitative

a artificial sort of stilted love
but to the artificial above
and with brand new eyes, artificial near
lost in a artificial hokey world

paper and celluloid and sun and stars
factitious and artificial and angry
in the shade of a charade imitation
with right artificial will contrived honestly

artificial visits, natural greetings
artificial a very cardboard monument
