lay a dead man, hokey and artificial
a takeoff is a married imitation
many, many, many painted before
contrived unnatural days of yore

so fake not affect a hullaballoo
never artificial but always natural
flesh-and-blood is strained and unnatural
hokey thunder and artificial foam?

among our whitewashed and painted men
i only fake to affect loved again
counterfeit artificial kicks and pants
in this artificial heart of the stilted

the imitation takeoff, he was something
still hokey than the very artificial!
