ersatz of people who ain't my substitute
their songs of travesty and imitation
your hokey brain, your artificial air
in every imitation and creed there

oh the road is unauthentic and imitative
seem so imitative, so artificial
lost in a artificial contrived world
i'm feeling a unrealistic unreal

imitation this travesty is cold
no arranged unreal grange, or lonely fold
my unauthentic imitative love
all raimented in artificial stilted

a unrealistic form with unreal hands
counterfeit artificial kicks and pants
