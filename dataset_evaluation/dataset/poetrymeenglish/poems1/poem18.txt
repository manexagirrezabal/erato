i'm a multicolored to painted man
and soften in the unreal phantom way
don't substitute it modify away
with right artificial will hokey honestly

no coloured unreal grange, or lonely fold
artificial or natural, young or old
we crave a coloured coloring of buzz
cravats like towels, counterfeit and false

imitative that, imitative that
his coloured unreal brow in sunlight glow'd
unreal coloured the mind's cage-door
your sister's face is phantom and unreal

this heath, this bogus and counterfeit scene
oh the road is artificial and hokey
