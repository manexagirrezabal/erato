the assumed years of the counterfeit child
love is artificial stylized and timeless
changing towards artificial or natural
and overhead of the natural winner

the artificial stylized sights of ours
when it's imitative, worse, artificial
i am serene and patient, unreal, dreamlike
he wheels a hokey artificial barrow

fool can mean artificial stylized things
celluloid rolls, but not from the McGuffin
his clothing, artificial and contrived
and with brand new eyes, artificial dyed

dreamlike, golden nerves of sly unreal curl'd
twin brothers, substitute and artificial
