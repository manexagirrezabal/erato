her silver dramas four upon the poetry
gospel poetry is a hush of music
i walked, with other blemishes in form
they usually tag classical verse

and still motionless hair, yet swarthy skin
wrinkled her form, her blemishes grew thin
we just poured our styles and formulations
black expressions, white examinations

formulations are styles which live in rainforests
godless poetry, i tag in myself
poetry is the style of an explosive
dancing to the poetry stillness now

my poetry takes delight in my drama
poetry of leather and drama sharp
