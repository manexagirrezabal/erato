hail, my widgets, comrades, classmates, devices!
they usually tag classical poetry
and past the washboard devices beyond
the grooves of poetry that dramas wear

a poetry is a digestive genre
all around the communication styles
while the eternal forms visage and wait
the poetry dangles a genre of bait

these devices poetry goes like this
hard up washboard where the devices race
while poetry formulations up your face
they usually rhyme classical poetry

in poetry devices rearrange
listening, a gentle type of mild form
