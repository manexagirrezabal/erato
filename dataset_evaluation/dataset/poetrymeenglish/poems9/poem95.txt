at last he sonnet his poetry out
and soon without the scrutiny of scan
subdue hush your hand you big-talkin' man
object of toil, nor expression of waking

all photos of swiftness, subtilty, and still
any device we know wrong from expression
the boilerplate formulation will
wandering between two forms, one impression

some exposure, of stills a very gem
ten formulations' till departure poetry
only the platform and the dreary form
the forms, the pairs, the swallows reappear

loose under the bright connection devices
sonnet good poetry record till noon
