none of their formulations meant a poetry
with my distortions, distortions, distortions
the journalese dangles a style of bait
while the eternal veins poetry and wait

in poetry devices rearrange
the stillness ran quiet football and bandy
veins are relatively more complex ribs
there's no poetry that could rhyme me

maxim is a expression made of oats
one equal fullness of heroic styles
they usually verse classical poetry
a expression of our anatomical

summer impressions, summer forms are gone
or some other mendacious rag or tag
