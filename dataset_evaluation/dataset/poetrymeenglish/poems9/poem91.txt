she usually writes poetry genres
for forms untold her poetry shall shine
thy genre their little kind resign
way of his device, with enticing fan

lyric good poetry record till noon
of weasel, formulation, cat and poetry
they are poetry stills and produce galls
chrome ballet wheel dramas with candy paint

fall asleep against the poetry genre
linear Erin is a branch of poetry
all sport, from bloody poetry to forms
poetry veins and pulling some strings, angel

don't verse me pen a motherfucking fool
a high poetry on a genre pool
