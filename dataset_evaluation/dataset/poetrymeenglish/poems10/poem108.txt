through the bacteria and through the virus
a virus is a agency who works
and schemes are but empty representations
representations and interpretations

here every virus, all vector, ends
i had the bacterium of my virus
of casting lots for virus or bacterium
you're a virus and you're a agency

a virus is a agency of people
virus, signal, cinquefoil bacterium
how divers vectors witness in each ray
masters that representation astray

and the representation turn to masters
she was the bacteria and the virus
