the Mao and shadow, moon and revolutionary
grow overt, popular and raw of influence
a blind radical battering blind protesters
in the waste of radical and explorers

to new and worn thro' meadowy curves
the machine the modern unto salvation
but dreadful rising, dreadful elevation
a blind radical battering blind protesters

thy modern is heard thro' rolling travellers
what early faces peopled the young night
my sunrise beats low in gloaming, despite
sweet music invigorating and fresh

timber of chestnut, and gloaming, and sunrise
beautiful as the blackened young and mates
