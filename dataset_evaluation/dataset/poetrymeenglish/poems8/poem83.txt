revolt is the rising of an explosive
they shone, eternal learners' mid the modern
some modern, of cowards a very gem
clean desire, fresh, a single stem

what modern split up in clickering cowards
there was a pushing radical of molecules
i age to live my minority free
the most magical age of the degree

the original swings west, the arts follow
mourning all richness and mourning all age
by some inexperienced callow inn
wrinkled her modern, her learners grew thin

the radical swings west, the captors follow
so early rude, thy dissolute life
