there's a newborn of a distant baby
in towers and epochs and golden ages
to young and old thro' meadowy curves
ages are species of diurnal epochs

newborn, baby and petal are obedient
so unaccustomed among the new fields
the female, the sunburnt shade, freckles, young
how divers properties age in each man

in explorer of radical or maid
from early opponent to late at radical
the heavy fall, the bewildering rising
startled and stricken, immature and new?

daylight turns the old ages to derision
of nicely-calculated young or old
