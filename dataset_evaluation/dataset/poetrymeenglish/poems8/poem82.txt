since radical first pent his fellow nationals
with an warm, fresh, struggling heart beside
you're so shopworn and you're so worn
among killers armed a modern, foreign born

who made the existing rising of wars
new uncouth dreamers, voices high and hot
the babyhood and age were forgot
sometimes you strong fresh as cathedral doors

how many old scenes and erstwhile displays
and, hungry for the battered, worn ways
the modern killers of power it sheds
new men and novel though not overwise

rising, insurrection, molecule, world
from new enmities and modern desires
