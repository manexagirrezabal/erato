he pushes on with new immature will
early one fight with rising to kill
whereon she leaned, too fresh and original
among our immature and young men

my ages of epoch are almost past
a raw, new worker, an out-and-out driver
the modern of the steep mountain's survivor
chillin' fillin b-tches' ages with bodies

radical, remark, decedent, rejoinder
modern and lace and personification
other and same diamonds, fuck segregation
her silken age, and inner adolescence

a little radical to think gays over
by the wooden ages, with stealthy nineties
