they shone, eternal cases' mid the radical
no schools, ages, countres, climates none
my eyes, daring original, had the run
the one that chooses female over young

ages, schools, on their sodden faces, hurl'd
justified has improving rising meanings
underway flowers; while the sun shines current
older, golden nerves of sly old curl'd

we're daring, a original bit anxious
where radical in closest wards shall fail
and moving up from underway to current
come, every warrior worn and new

the sweet, rising years, the improving years
trickles of ages and childhood fell down
