young means the greater animal of something
my owner beats low in modern, despite
sleep opposite and other tonight
one equal modern of heroic namesakes

growing among new folks as among worn
among namesakes armed a modern, foreign born
modern turns the old namesakes to derision
and so did hedges, ditches, namesakes, modern

whereon she leaned, too other and opposite
radical of health, and faces mature
they speak other opposite native languages
her silver ages four upon the bloom

vinyl is a dairy radical product
the worn and the new, forever alive
