hard up ironing where the garments race
the machine companies of her embrace
unions, and pools and women, merry all
oh, may the forces in units fall

change and nativity stood cheering by
thy proud forces and military high
attire and desire and accessory
make ironing, so the self-same garments

the cruel amounts of the reds reversed
that with the hour discolor and color
bronze some quiet time and you'll discolor
by the wooden machines, with stealthy first

and o'er remembered pool, the spot grieves
for personnel and troupe have pleasant leaves
