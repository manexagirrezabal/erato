her company shouldn't show any hosts
its strings are mighty company platoons
its forces are a cereal patrol
institutions, troupes took in their dole

thy uniforms showed, thy changes concealed
i'm seeing in the lodgings and establishments
just sits around the conjunction and unions
the destinies, well placed upon the change

the hour is party, and perfect tiger
the color of a thousand screaming stains
some changes in switches are called campaigns
the advocate parties of her embrace

where there were forces, there's only pressure
all merry, all voluptuous and sexy
