in one another's garment finding robe
in computing, a party is a mortal
accoutrements is the study of wearable
garments and accessories, he didn't care

she wanna animate change care'n of
wear sailaway frazzle in love with love
gospel computing is a host of music
organisation hierarchies of passion

party is a hard metamorphic mortal
sacrilegious air and blasphemous light
set with accessories and garments bright
among forces armed a soul, foreign born

the better lefties of machine were ours
go out to change, yet discolor within
