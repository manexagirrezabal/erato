The virus is a sneaky little devil
That invades your cells and makes you ill
There's no escape once it has you
It multiplies and spreads like wildfire
There's no known cure for this pest
So you just have to hope you're lucky
And it doesn't hit you hard
This little invader can be deadly
So be on your guard and take precautions
Or you might end up like so many others
Who have lost their lives to this monster.
