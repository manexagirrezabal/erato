A virus is a tiny agent
That slips into your system
And takes over your cells
Making them do its bidding.

It's a shape-shifter
That can hide in any form
And it's hard to fight
Because it's so small.

But it's not invincible
And there are ways to beat it
If you catch it early
And get treatment.

So be vigilant
And keep your immune system strong
And you'll stay healthy
And free from viruses.
