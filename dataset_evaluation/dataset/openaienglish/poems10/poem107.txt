A virus, so small and insignificant
Looking for a host to invade
To multiply and cause destruction
A scourge on humanity
But also a part of life
A necessary evil
Helping to keep populations in check
And nature in balance
Until it mutates and becomes a threat
To the very existence of mankind
Then it must be eradicated
But it will always be there
 Lurking in the shadows
Ready to strike again
