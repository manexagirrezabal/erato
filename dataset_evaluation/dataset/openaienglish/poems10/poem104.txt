A virus is something small and insignificant
But it can be so deadly, it can take your life
It invades your body without any warning
And can leave you lying in a hospital bed
There is no cure for the virus once you have it
So you just have to hope and pray that you survive
It can affect anyone, young or old
And there’s no telling who will be next
So be careful when you’re out and about
And always make sure you’re up to date on your shots
