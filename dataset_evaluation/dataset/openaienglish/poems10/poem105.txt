Whenever I am near, I make you ill
My presence is unwanted, yet you can't resist
You try to fight me off, but I'm too strong
Before you know it, you're weak and sick
I take control of your body and your mind
Your thoughts are now my own, your will is gone
You can't escape me, there's no cure for you
I'm a virus that will always survive
