A virus, so tiny and frail

Yet it can cause so much pain

It invades our bodies without care

And leaves us feeling quite drained

But even though it makes us feel ill

We can sometimes fight it off

And eventually we may recover

But we'll always carry the scars

This little invader is quite ruthless

And can cause a lot of harm

But we must never give up hope

For science may yet find a cure
