When I was younger, I thought that poetry
Was something fusty and old,
Reserved for dusty books on library shelves
Or for reading in the rain.

I could not have been more wrong,
For poetry is like a song
That we write with our lives
And it's never too late to start.

So don't be afraid to open up a book
And let the words take you for a ride,
For poetry is a magic carpet
That can take you anywhere you want to go.
