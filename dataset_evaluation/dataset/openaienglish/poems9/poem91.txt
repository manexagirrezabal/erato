Poetry is the language of the heart
Expressing emotions that we all share
A way to transcend the mundane and everyday
And express what we feel in a way that's unique

Poetry can make us laugh, or make us cry
It can make us feel joy, or make us feel pain
It can touch our souls and make us feel whole
Or make us question everything we've known

But ultimately, poetry is about expression
It's a way to share our innermost thoughts
And it can be a source of comfort and healing
For anyone who is willing to listen
