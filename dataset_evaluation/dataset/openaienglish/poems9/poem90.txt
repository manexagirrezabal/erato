Poetry is the language of the heart
It is the way we express our deepest feelings
It is the way we share our innermost thoughts
It is the way we communicate with the world

Poetry is the way we share our dreams and our hopes
It is the way we tell our stories and our truths
It is the way we reveal our passions and our fears
It is the way we show our love and our hate

Poetry is the way we speak to the soul
It is the way we touch the human spirit
It is the way we open our minds and our hearts
It is the way we find our way in the world
