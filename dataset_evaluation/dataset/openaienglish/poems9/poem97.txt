Poetry is the music of the heart,
The language of the soul.
It is the breath of life,
The light of the world.
It is the voice of the ages,
The echo of the past.
It is the song of the present,
The promise of the future.
It is the essence of humanity,
The voice of the gods.
Poetry is the highest form of art,
The embodiment of beauty.
It is the language of love,
The poetry of life.
