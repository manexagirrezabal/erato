Poetry is the music of the heart,
the language of the soul.
It is the breath of life,
the light of the world.

Poetry is the first love of the heart,
the last breath of life.
It is the way we see the world,
the way we feel the world.

Poetry is the beginning and the end,
the alpha and the omega.
It is the way we understand ourselves,
the way we understand the world.
