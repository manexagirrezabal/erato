Poetry is the language of the heart
It's a way to express emotions we can't put into words
It's a way to feel things we can't feel on our own
Poetry is a way to connect with the world
It's a way to share our stories and our dreams
It's a way to make a difference in the world
Poetry is a way to make the world a better place
It's a way to make people feel loved and understood
It's a way to make people feel connected to each other
Poetry is a way to make the world a better place.
