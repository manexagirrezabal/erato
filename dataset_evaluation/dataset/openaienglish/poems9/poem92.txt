Poetry is the language of the heart
It is the way we express our love
It is the way we share our thoughts
And the way we connect with others

Poetry is the way we touch the lives of others
It is a way to share our feelings
And to connect with others on a deeper level

Poetry is the way we show our emotions
It is the way we share our memories
And the way we connect with others in our lives

Poetry is the way we show our love and our care
It is the way we connect with others in the world
And the way we show that we are truly alive
