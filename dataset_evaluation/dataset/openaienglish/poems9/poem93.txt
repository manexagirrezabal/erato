Poetry is the music of the heart,
The language of the soul.
It is the song of the spirit,
The voice of the ages.

It is the story of our lives,
The record of our dreams.
It is the map of our journey,
The guide to our destiny.

Poetry is the light that guides us home,
The star that leads us to the truth.
It is the compass that shows us the way,
The mirror that reflects our beauty.

Poetry is the love that fills our lives,
The light that guides us through the night.
It is the hope that sustains us in times of sorrow,
The voice of compassion that speaks to our hearts.

Thank you, poetry,
For showing us the way,
For giving us hope,
For filling our lives with love.
