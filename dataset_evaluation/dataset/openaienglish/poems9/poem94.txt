Poetry is the language of the heart,
Born from the depths of the soul.
It is the music of the ages,
The voice of the ages.

Poetry is the beauty of the world,
The light that guides us through the night.
It is the hope that fills our hearts,
The dream that never dies.

Poetry is the fire that burns inside us,
The passion that sets us free.
It is the love that we all long for,
The beauty that we all seek.
