Blue is the colour of the sky,
And the ocean,And the eyes of a loved one.
Blue is the colour of the morning,
And the evening,
And the middle of the day.
Blue is the colour of the calm,
And the storm,
And the in-between.
Blue is the colour of the north,
And the south,
And the east, and the west.
Blue is the colour of the past,
And the present,
And the future.
Blue is the colour of the known,
And the unknown,
And the unknowable.
Blue is the colour of the possible,
And the impossible,
And the forever.
