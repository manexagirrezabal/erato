Blue is the color of the sky
And the ocean, and a baby's eyes
It's the color of a robin's egg
And a field of clover in the spring
Blue is the color of a cooling breeze
And a blueberry muffin with lots of cream
It's the color of a new Corvette
And a deep, dark lagoon
Blue is the color of a summer storm
And a clear, cold winter's night
It's the color of a dolphin's back
And a baby's pacifier
Blue is the color of a new day
And a new beginning, every time
It's the color of the sky
And the ocean, and a baby's eyes
