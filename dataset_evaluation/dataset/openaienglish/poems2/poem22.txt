Blue is the colour of the sky,
The colour of the sea,
The colour of the love we share,
And the colour of our dreams.

Blue is the colour of the morning,
The colour of the evening,
The colour of the sun and the moon,
And the colour of the stars.

Blue is the colour of the world,
The colour of the universe,
The colour of the love we make,
And the colour of the love we find.
