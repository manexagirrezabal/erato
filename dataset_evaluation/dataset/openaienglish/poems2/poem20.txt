Blue, blue, blue.
It's the color of the sky,
And it's the color of my eyes.
It's the color of the ocean,
And it's the color of the sky.

Blue is the color of the heavens,
And it's the color of my heart.
It's the color of the clouds,
And it's the color of the sky.

Blue is the color of the sadness,
And it's the color of the joy.
It's the color of the love,
And it's the color of the sky.
