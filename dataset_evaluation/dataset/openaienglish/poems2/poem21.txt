The blue of the sky, the blue of the sea,
the blue of the eyes of my love.

The blue of the sky, so bright and clear,
gives hope to the world, and love to the heart.

The blue of the sea is deep and wide,
a place of mystery and adventure.

The blue of the eyes of my love is
the color of happiness and love.
