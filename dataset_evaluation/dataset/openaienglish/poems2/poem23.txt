Blue is the sky's serene and perfect hue,
A color of the ocean's depth and dune,
A shade that's cool and calming to the eye,
A hue that's both serene and tranquil.

Blue is the sky's celestial canopy,
A hue that's sometimes somber and sometimes bright,
A color of the ocean's deep and wide expanse,
A shade that can be both serene and tranquil.

Blue is the sky's ethereal and sublime hue,
A color of the ocean's pristine and calm shore,
A shade that's cool and refreshing to the eye,
A hue that's both serene and tranquil.
