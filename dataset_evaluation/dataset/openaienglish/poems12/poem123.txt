A facemask shields and protects,
keeping out the dirt and the grit,
the germs and the grime.
It keeps us from getting sick,
from catching a cold or the flu,
from developing a sinus infection.
It is a safeguard against the world,
a barrier between us and the dangers out there.
We can go about our day,
our lives,
knowing that we are safe,
protected by the facemask.
