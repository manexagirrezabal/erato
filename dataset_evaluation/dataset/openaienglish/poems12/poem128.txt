A facemask shields my face from the world 
It is my armor, my disguise 
It is what I put on when I don't want to be seen 
It is what I wear when I don't want to be bothered 
It is my shield, my protector 
It is what keeps me safe 
It is my friend 
It is my ally 
Without it, I am vulnerable 
I am exposed 
I am naked 
But with it, I am shielded 
I am protected 
I am safe 
Thank you, facemask, for keeping me safe 
Thank you for being my friend 
Thank you for being my ally 
Thank you for being there for me 
Thank you for being my armor 
Thank you for being my disguise 
Thank you for being my shield 
Thank you for being my protector 
Thank you for being my friend.
