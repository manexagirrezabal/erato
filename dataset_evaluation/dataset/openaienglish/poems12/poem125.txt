A facemask to protect us from the germs,
to keep our lungs from the dirt and grime,
to shield us from the flu and the cold,
to keep our noses from the stench of death.

We put it on when we're sick and sore,
to keep us from getting any worse,
to help us get well and back to work,
to keep our families from getting sick.

It's a lifesaver, a protector,
a shield against the dangers of the world,
a way to keep us all healthy and safe,
a way to keep us all alive.
