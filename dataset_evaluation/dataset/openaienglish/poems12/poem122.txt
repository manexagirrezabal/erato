When I put on my facemask
I become a new person
I can be anyone I want to be
I can be strong
I can be brave
I can be powerful
I can be whatever I want to be
When I put on my facemask
I become someone new
Someone better than who I am
Someone who can do anything
And when I take off my facemask
I can be myself again
But I am not the same person
I am stronger
I am braver
I am more powerful
I am whoever I want to be
Thanks to my facemask
I am not afraid to be anyone
