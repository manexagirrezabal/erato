Worn as protection from the air,
a facemask shields your lungs and eyes
from the dangers that lurk in the sky.
Its filters keep out the dirt and grime,
while the mask's straps keep it in place
so you can work without fear of harm.
A facemask is a lifesaver, in more ways
than one: it can keep you alive and well,
and it can also keep your appearance clean
in a world that's full of filth and disease.
