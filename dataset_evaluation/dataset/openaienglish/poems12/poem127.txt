Facemask, a simple cloth
But it means the world to me
It's all I have to keep me safe
From the dangers that I see

Without it, I'm exposed
To the germs and the dirt
All the things that could make me sick
And I couldn't take the risk

So I put it on every day
And I thank it for keeping me safe
For protecting me from harm
It's my guardian and my friend
