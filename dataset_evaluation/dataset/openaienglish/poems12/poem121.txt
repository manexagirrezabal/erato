As I put on my facemask
I can feel the plastic against my skin
I can feel the tight seal
And I can feel the air being forced in
I take a deep breath
And I can feel the air being forced out
I can feel the mask sticking to my face
I can feel the sweat on my forehead
I can feel the mask slipping off my face
I can feel the plastic against my skin
I can feel the tight seal
And I can feel the air being forced in
