A facemask to protect the skin
From the environment and the sun
Is a must for those who love the outdoors
And want to keep their skin looking young.

A facemask also filters out the dirt
And the pollution in the air
Which is a good thing for those who live in cities
Where the air is not so fresh.

A facemask is also a good thing
For those who are sick and have a cold
Since it will help them breathe a little easier
And keep them from getting sicker.
