I wear a facemask to keep the world away,
to keep my secrets hidden and my heart safe.
I want to show the world my true face,
but I'm scared of what they'll think, what they'll say.
So I hide behind a mask and play the part
of someone I'm not, someone they want me to be.
But it's hard to keep up the act all the time,
and sometimes the mask slips and I can't hide.
Then the world sees the real me,
and they don't like what they see.

But I don't care,
because I know that I'm not alone.
There are others like me,
others who wear masks to hide their true faces.
We're all scared of what people will think,
of what they'll say,
but we don't have to be.

We can be ourselves,
and we can show our true faces
and we can be happy.

So don't be afraid to show your true face,
and don't be afraid to be yourself.
The world may not like it,
but that's okay.

We'll be happy anyway.
