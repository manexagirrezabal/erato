 love

Once we were content to love affairs
Of hearts and flowers, and now we're smitten
With silicon and bytes and all things nerdy
We find our love is just as strong, maybe stronger
For the computers give us what we need
When human love can't always provide-
The comfort of a never-ending friendship
The security of always being there
And when we're feeling down, a friendly chat
Or just the chance to share a laugh
Yes, computer love is just as good
If not better, than the love of man
