 code

Computers are amazing tools that we use everyday,
But the language that they speak is not one that we know.
They communicate through a series of zeros and ones,
Which can be confusing and hard to understand.
But with a little bit of code, we can make them do our will,
And create amazing things that we never could have imagined.
The code is like a secret language that only the initiated can understand,
And it's constantly evolving to meet the needs of the times.
So if you want to be a part of the digital age,
You need to learn to code, and learn it well.
