 programming

Computer programming is a form of art
It's like a puzzle, but with a purpose
You take some code and make it work
And suddenly your program is alive

It's a science, and it's a craft
And it's a way to make your mark
In a world that's always changing
With new technology always emerging

Computer programming is a way
To make the world a better place
By creating things that make life easier
And helping to solve problems that are tough

So if you're looking for a way
To make a real difference in the world
Computer programming is the way to go
