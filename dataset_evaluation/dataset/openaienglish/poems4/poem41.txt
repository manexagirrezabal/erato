 addiction


In this digital age,
we are constantly tethered to our screens.
Our minds are transfixed
by the endless cycle of clicking and scrolling.

We are slaves to the dopamine rush
that comes with each new notification.
We are addicted to the feeling
of being constantly connected.

Our relationships are suffering
as we spend more time online
than we do talking to the people right in front of us.

Our minds are becoming numb
as we're bombarded with irrelevant information.

We need to break free from this addiction
and reconnect with the real world.

Let's put down our phones
and enjoy the beauty of nature.
Let's talk to each other
and build meaningful relationships.

Let's unplug from the digital world
and rediscover the joys of life.
