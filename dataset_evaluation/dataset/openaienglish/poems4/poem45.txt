 technology

Computers have come to be a part of our everyday lives,
Used for tasks as simple as checking the weather,
And as complex as managing a business.
The speed and efficiency of these machines
Is nothing short of amazing; they never get tired
And can carry out multiple tasks simultaneously.
Their capabilities are increasing all the time
As programmers find new ways to use them;
They've even become a part of our entertainment.
Though we sometimes take them for granted,
We would be lost without them in this modern age.

Their influence is growing every day,
And it's hard to imagine what our world would be like
Without the amazing computer technology
