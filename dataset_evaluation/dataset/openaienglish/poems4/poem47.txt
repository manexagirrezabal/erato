 programming

To write code is to create a thing of beauty,
A symphony of logic and precision,
A work of art that can be both utilitarian 
And elegant, concise and powerful.

Like a composer with her orchestra,
A programmer can bring disparate elements
Together to form a cohesive whole,
A system that does what it is supposed to.

And when it all comes together,
When the code is executed and the system works,
It is a thing of joy and wonder,
A thing of beauty and intelligence.
