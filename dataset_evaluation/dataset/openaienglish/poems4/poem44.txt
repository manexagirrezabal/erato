Computers are amazing tools that we use every day.
They can help us do amazing things,
And they never get tired or complain.

But like any other tool, they have their limits.
They can only do what we tell them to do,
And they can only go as fast as we can make them go.

We need to be careful with them,
And use them wisely,
For they are a powerful force in our lives.
