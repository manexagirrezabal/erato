 addiction

Compulsive clicking of the mouse,
Keyboard tapping late into the night,
Staring at the screen with a trance-like gaze,
These are the telltale signs of a computer addict.

You try to resist, but the allure is too strong,
The siren song of the internet calling your name,
You can't help but give in to the temptation,
Logging in for one more round of games.

Your work suffers, your relationships suffer,
But you can't help but keep coming back,
Addicted to the dopamine rush of the web,
Consumed by your need to surf and click.

There's no turning back now, you're hooked for life,
But at least you know you're not alone,
We're all addicts in our own way,
 united by our love of the screen.
