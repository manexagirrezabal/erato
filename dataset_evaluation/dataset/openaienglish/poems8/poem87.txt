 love



New love is a flame that burns
Bright and hot in our hearts
It fills us with happiness and hope
And makes us feel alive

Every moment we spend together
Is a joyous adventure
We can't get enough of each other
And we can't imagine life without

This new love is a gift
A precious thing we must protect
It's something we want to nurture
And grow stronger every day

We'll do anything to keep it alive
And we'll never take it for granted

We'll cherish this new love
And never let it go
