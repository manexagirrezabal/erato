 love

New love is a flame
That burns inside of us
And can never be quenched
It's a feeling so strong
That we can't resist

It's what makes us feel alive
And fills us with hope
It's the one thing
That can make us happy

When we're with the one we love
We feel like we can do anything
We're so in love with them
That we can't imagine our lives without them

And we can't help but smile
When we think of them
We just want to be with them
And we're so happy
We've found new love
