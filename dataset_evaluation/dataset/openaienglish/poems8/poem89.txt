 love

When I was younger I was taught
That love was something that would come and go
A feeling that would fade away with time
I'm so glad that I was wrong
Love is something that grows stronger every day
As we learn more about each other
It fills our hearts with happiness
And we can't help but smile
Every time we're together
We're so in love with each other
There's nothing we wouldn't do
To keep the love alive
We can't imagine our lives without each other
And we're so thankful for this new love
That we've found
