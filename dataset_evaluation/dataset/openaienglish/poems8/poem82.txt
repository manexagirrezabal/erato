 love

New love is like a rose,
It's sweet, and pure, and smells nice,
It's something you want to hold on to,
And never let go.

New love is special,
It's something you never want to lose,
It's a feeling that's so strong,
You just can't let it go.

New love is exciting,
It makes you feel alive,
It's something you can't wait to experience,
It's a feeling you'll never forget.
