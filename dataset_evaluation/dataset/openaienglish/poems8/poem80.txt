 love

New love is a bright light in the dark
It's the sun on a cloudy day
It's a smile in the face of sadness
It's a flame that can never be quenched

New love is a fresh start
It's a new beginning
It's a chance to rewrite the past
It's a hope for the future

New love is a miracle
It's a sign from the gods
It's a reason to be happy
It's a reason to be alive

New love is everything
It's the best thing that's ever happened to me
It's what makes life worth living
It's what keeps me going

Thank you, new love, for coming into my life
Thank you for making me happy
Thank you for making me feel alive

You are the best thing that's ever happened to me
And I will never forget you
