 love

New love is like a rose,
Buds bursting with promise,
Filling the air with fragrance.

New love is fresh and bright,
A flame that burns so brightly,
It's hard to look away.

New love is everything,
All at once, it's everything,
A rainbow after the rain.

New love is a hope for the future,
A dream come true,
The most beautiful thing.
