 love

Though I have loved before, I have never loved
like this.
For this love is new, and it fills me with
happiness I never knew before.

This love is fresh and new, like a morning
sunrise.
It fills me with warmth and happiness,
and I never want it to end.

This love is so strong, I know it will
last forever.
It's a love that I never thought possible,
but now I know it's real.

I never want to lose this feeling,
this new love that has come into my life.
I want to hold on to it forever, and never let it go.
