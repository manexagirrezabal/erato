 love

Infatuated with the new love in your life,
you can't get them out of your head.
You think about them all the time,
and you can't wait to see them again.

You feel like you're on cloud nine
whenever you're around them,
and you can't help but smile.

You're constantly dreaming about
what the future might hold for you two,
and you can't wait to find out.

There's nothing you wouldn't do for this person,
and you're ready to give them your heart.

You're convinced that this is the real thing,
and you can't wait to see where it takes you.
