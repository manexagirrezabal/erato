Football is a game of many
Possession is the key to victory
A quarterback must be able to throw
And a running back must be able to run
The linemen must be able to block
And the receivers must be able to catch
In order for a team to be successful
The defense must be able to tackle
And the kicker must be able to kick
A football game is won or lost
By how well each player performs
