The thrill of the game, the snap of the ball
The sound of helmets colliding, the feel of the turf
The fans in the stands, the players on the field
The strategy of the game, the drive for the goal
The touchdown, the interception, the final score
These are the things that make football the greatest game
There's nothing like it anywhere on earth
It's the ultimate test of strength, agility, and skill
For players and fans alike, it's the ultimate thrill
