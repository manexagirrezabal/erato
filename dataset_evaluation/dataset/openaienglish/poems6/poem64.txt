In the fall, when the leaves turn brown
and the air grows chill,
all the boys put on their pads
and go out to play football.

They run and they tackle,
and the ball flies through the air.
The crowd cheers and the players
sprint down the field.

It's a beautiful game,
full of teamwork and strategy.
No one knows who will win
until the final whistle blows.

So come on, everyone,
put on your helmets and pads.
It's time to play some football!
