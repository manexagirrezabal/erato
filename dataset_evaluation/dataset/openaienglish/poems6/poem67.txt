A game of two halves,
football is a sport that’s hard to beat.
In the first half the players run and
kick the ball as hard as they can,
trying to score a goal.
In the second half they do the same
thing, but this time they’re trying to keep
the other team from scoring.
It’s a game that’s full of action,
and it’s never boring to watch.
