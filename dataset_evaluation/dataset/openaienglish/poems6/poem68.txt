Football is a beautiful game

The way the players move

So fluid and graceful

It's like they are floating

The ball seems to be a part of them

And they can control it

With such ease

It's like they are one with the ball

And the ball is a part of them

The crowd is cheering

And the players are scoring

It's a beautiful sight

To see football being played

The way it was meant to be played
