A pandemic is sweeping the nation,
Casting a shadow of death and despair.
Our people are dying by the thousands,
And yet we do nothing to prevent it.

We watch as our loved ones succumb to the virus,
And yet we still do nothing to help.
We bury our heads in the sand and hope
That it will all go away and leave us be.

But the pandemic is not going away,
It is only getting worse with each day.
And still we do nothing to stop it,
To save our people from this terrible fate.

Perhaps we are too blind to see
The disaster that is happening right before our eyes.
Or maybe we just don't care
That so many of our people are dying.

But one day, we will all regret
Not doing anything to stop this pandemic.
One day, we will all mourn
The loss of so many loved ones,
And we will know that we could have done something
To prevent it all from happening.
