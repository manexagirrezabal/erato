We are living in a time
of great potential peril
A pandemic could sweep the world
And take us all by surprise
It could kill many, or make many sick
It could leave our world in disarray
But we must not give in to fear
We must not let this pandemic take us down
We must stand up and fight against it
We must do all we can to prevent it
If we work together we can beat this thing
We can prevent a pandemic from happening
So let's all work together
And keep our world safe and sound
