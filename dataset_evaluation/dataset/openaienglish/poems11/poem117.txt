When death is in the air and all around,
No one is safe from the pandemic.
People flee in droves from the contagion,
Leaving their homes, their families, their lives.
The disease is rampant, and there's no cure,
No hope for those who are stricken with it.
The only thing to do is to run and hide,
To hope that you're not the next one to die.
This is the world we live in today,
A world of fear and of death and of doom.
Is there no end to the pandemic?
No hope for those who are caught in its grip?
Let us hope that someday we will find
A cure for this disease that has no name,
That will free us from its deadly grasp,
And bring us back to a world of hope.
