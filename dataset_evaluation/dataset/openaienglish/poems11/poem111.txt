The plague is coming, the rats are fleeing
The air is thick with death, and yet we're blind
We scurry about our days as if there's nothing wrong
While bodies pile up and the sickness spreads
It's only a matter of time before we're all hit
And yet we do nothing to prepare
We think that it won't happen to us
That we're immune to the disease
But it will catch up with us all
And when it does, there will be no escape
Our world will be turned upside down
And death will be all around us
So let us not be foolish
And let us start preparing now
For the pandemic that is sure to come
