A pandemic is sweeping the land,
Carrying death in its wake.
People are falling ill and dying
In numbers we can no longer ignore.
This is a plague we cannot defeat,
A disease that knows no bounds.
It is spreading like wildfire
And there is no cure in sight.
This is a horror we did not foresee,
A nightmare we cannot escape.
But we must not give up hope,
For there is still a chance we can survive.
We must work together
To find a way to beat this disease.
We cannot let it win,
For the sake of all those who are fighting
And for the future of our world.
