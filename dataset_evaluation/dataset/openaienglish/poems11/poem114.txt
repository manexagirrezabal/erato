A pandemic is sweeping the land,
A sickness that knows no bounds,
Carrying off young and old,
Destroying families and homes.

The doctors can do nothing,
The drugs have all been tried,
And still the pandemic thrives,
Spreading like wildfire.

People are dying by the thousands,
Infected by a deadly virus,
While the rest of us can only watch,
Helpless to stop the carnage.

This is a plague without mercy,
A scourge that knows no end,
And we can only pray that God
Will have mercy on us all.
