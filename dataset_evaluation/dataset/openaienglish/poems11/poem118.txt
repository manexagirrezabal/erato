A pandemic is sweeping the land,
killing thousands, those who are spared
watch in horror as the death toll mounts
and there seems to be no end in sight.

People are dying in droves, and still
the world does nothing to stop the spread
of this sickness, this scourge of man.

It seems that we are powerless to do
anything but watch as the pandemic takes
more and more lives. What a dark time
this is, when death stalks us in our homes
and we can do nothing to stop it.
