A pandemic is sweeping the earth,
Carrying off young and old,
Leaving families in mourning,
As the disease takes its toll.

There is no escaping it,
No matter where you hide,
As the virus spreads like wildfire,
Destroying everything in its path.

There is no hope of a cure,
No end in sight,
As the pandemic devastates the world,
Leaving a trail of death and destruction.

May God have mercy on us all,
As we face this dark hour,
And help us find the strength to carry on,
In the midst of this terrible pandemic.
