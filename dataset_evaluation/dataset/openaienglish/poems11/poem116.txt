When Death himself comes knocking at our door,
we think it's only a matter of time
before he claims us for his own.
But sometimes life provides us with a far greater fear,
a terror that can sweep across the land
like wildfire, leaving in its wake
a trail of devastation and despair.
A pandemic, a plague of biblical proportions,
that could wipe out humanity as we know it.
We watch in horror as it spreads like a virus
infecting city after city, country after country,
until there seems to be no hope of survival.
But still we fight, we cling to life
even as it slips through our fingers.
In the end, it may be Death that wins,
but not before we've suffered immeasurably.
