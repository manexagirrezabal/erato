To climb a building, sans ropes or gear,
Is a feat of daring and strength most rare;
But to do so with style and grace is true art,
A show of confidence and fearlessness.

Those who buildeer know no bounds,
As they scale the sides of skyscrapers bold,
Defying gravity with each step they take,
In a dance that is both thrilling and dangerous.

For these brave souls, there is no fear,
No stopping until they reach the top;
Their only goal is to push themselves
To accomplish something that most would never dare.
