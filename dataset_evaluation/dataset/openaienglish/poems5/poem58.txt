In this great city of ours,

We see so much construction day by day.

Towers reaching for the sky,

Steel beams and concrete,

All in the name of progress.

But what about the builders themselves?

The ones who toil in the heat and the dust,

Who sacrifice their time and their health,

So that others might have a better life?

These are the real heroes of our age,

The ones who make our city great.

They are the ones who build our future,

With their sweat and their blood.

So let us salute the builders of our city,

And thank them for all that they have done.
