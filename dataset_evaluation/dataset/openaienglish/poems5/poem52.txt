Building is the art of stacking things;
A child's first tower of blocks,
A house of cards,
A skyscraper of stone.

To build is to create, to make something new
From what is given, to take what is given
And make it into something more.

The builder is an artist,
A sculptor of stone and steel,
A creator of worlds.

The builder is a hero,
A pioneer of new frontiers,
A conqueror of space.

The builder is a god,
A master of the universe,
A creator of worlds.
