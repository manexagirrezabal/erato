A skyscraper reaching to the sky,
A sturdy bridge spanning a wide river,
A house standing tall and strong against
The elements, each is a symbol
Of man's capacity to build.

With simple tools and careful planning,
Man can create structures that defy
The laws of nature, that rise high
Above the earth and offer shelter
From the storm. Man's capacity to build
Is a tribute to his ingenuity
And his perseverance.

The skyscraper is a symbol
Of man's quest for knowledge and enlightenment,
The bridge is a symbol
Of man's ability to overcome adversity,
The house is a symbol
Of man's strength and resilience.

Man's capacity to build is a tribute
To the human spirit and its ability
To overcome any obstacle.
