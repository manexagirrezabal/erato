ering

I love to climb, to feel the burn
in my muscles, to reach the top
and see the world from a new perspective.

There's something about buildering
that's just so freeing, so exhilarating,
so addicting.

Every time I scale a new wall
I feel like I'm conquering the world,
and I can't help but get hooked
on the thrill of it all.

So if you see me climbing a building
don't be surprised, because
I'm addicted to the thrill of buildering.
