Buildering is a way to have fun

With just a bit of risk and some fun

You can scale any building in town

With just the clothes on your back and a frown

But buildering is not for the faint of heart

Or those who are scared of heights or falling

You need strength, balance and courage

To scale a building like a giant bird

So if you're looking for an extreme sport

And you're not afraid of a little danger

Buildering is the thing for you

So put on your brave face and get to climbing
