ering


Buildering is a sport that is all about conquering obstacles.

You are not afraid of heights, because you know that you can
climb anything.

Your muscles are strong, and your mind is focused.

You are in control as you navigate your way up the wall.

The challenge is what keeps you coming back for more.

There is nothing like the feeling of conquering a difficult climb.

You are a builderer, and you are fearless.
