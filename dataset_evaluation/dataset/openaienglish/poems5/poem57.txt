ering


Building, scaling, and conquering
Nature's obstacles
With hands and feet and heart
Passion and purpose
For the love of the climb
The journey is the reward

The wind in your hair
The sun on your face
The world at your feet
As you reach for the stars

The thrill of the climb
The sense of accomplishment
The feeling of being alive
This is what buildering is all about
