To build a life you must have a plan
A foundation that is strong and true
With pillars that will hold up the weight
A roof to keep the bad out and the good in
And a heart that will never give up
This is what it takes to build a life
A life that is strong and will never fall
A life that is filled with happiness
And a life that is worth living
