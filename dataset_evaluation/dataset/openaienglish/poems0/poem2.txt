Love is a never-ending mystery

It surrounds us and yet we can't see

It's something that we feel but can't explain

And yet it touches us in so many ways

Love is the light that guides us through the dark

And the hope that we cling to in our hearts

It's the one thing that we all long for

And the one thing that we can never have

But even though it's out of our reach

We can still find happiness in love

For love is the most beautiful thing in the world
