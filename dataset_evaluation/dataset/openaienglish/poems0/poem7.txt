Love is a virtue, a feeling of strong attachment

It is a bond that unites us, it is a force that guides us

It is the light that guides our path, it is what makes us happy

It is the thing that we all search for, it is what makes us complete

Without love, we are nothing, love is the most important thing

It is what makes us strong, it is what makes us happy

Without love, life is meaningless, love is the only thing that matters

And in the end, that is all that we will take with us
