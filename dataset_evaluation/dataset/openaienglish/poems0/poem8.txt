When I am with you, I am complete
I never have to worry, I am at peace
Your love is all I need to feel complete
It's the only thing that truly matters to me
I don't need riches, I don't need fame
All I need is your love and I'll be fine
I know that we'll be together forever
And nothing can tear us apart

I love you with all of my heart
And I'll always be there for you
I'll never let you down
I'll always be by your side
I love you, I love you, I love you
There's nothing I wouldn't do for you
I'll always be there for you
I love you, I love you, I love you
