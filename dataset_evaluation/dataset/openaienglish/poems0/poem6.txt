Love is a never-ending story

It starts with a single word
And ends with a lifetime of memories

Love is the light that guides us through the dark
It's the smile that we see in the mirror
It's the hand that we reach for in the middle of the night

Love is the one thing that never changes
It's always there, no matter what
It's the one thing that we can always count on

Love is the best thing that's ever happened to us
It's the reason we're here today
And we wouldn't want to live without it

Thank you, love, for always being there
For making our lives complete
We love you, and we'll always love you

Always.
