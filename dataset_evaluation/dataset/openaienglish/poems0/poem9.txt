Love is a many splendored thing
It makes the world go round
And if you're ever feeling down
Love will pick you up right off the ground
It's like a ray of sunshine
That comes to brighten up your day
And you can't help but smile
When you think of the love you've found
Love is a beautiful thing
And you never want to let it go
It's the best thing that's ever happened to you
And you'll always be grateful
For the love that you've been given
