Love is the light that guides us through the dark

And the love that we have is the best thing that's ever happened

We're so in love that we can't imagine life without it

And we'll always be together, no matter what happens

Our love is so strong that we can face anything

And we'll never stop loving each other

We're the perfect match, and we were meant to be together

Our love is true and everlasting
