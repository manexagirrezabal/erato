Love is a light that never goes out

It's always there, no matter what

You can try to hide it, but it's always there

You can try to ignore it, but it's always there

It's always shining, always burning

It's the light that guides us through the dark

It's the light that keeps us going

It's the light that never goes out

And we can't live without it

We need love to survive

It's the most important thing in the world

And we can't live without it

We need love to survive
