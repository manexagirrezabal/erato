Love is an emotion

So strong it can make you feel

Like you're floating on a cloud

And your heart is singing with joy

It's a feeling that is hard to describe

But it's so wonderful you can't help but smile

When you're in love, you feel like you can do anything

And you want to spend every moment with the person you love

Love is the best feeling in the world

And you never want it to end
