Love is a never-ending story

A tale that's been told for centuries

A feeling that's so pure and true

It can never be wrong

It's the light that guides us through

The darkness of life

And it's always there

No matter what happens

It's the one thing that we can rely on

To make us feel whole

And it's the one thing

That we can never lose

No matter what happens

Love is the most beautiful thing

And it's worth fighting for

Always
