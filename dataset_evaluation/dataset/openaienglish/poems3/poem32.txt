leness

Though some may say it's a curse,
I've come to see that singleness
Is a special kind of bliss.

There's nothing like being free
To come and go as I please,
Without having to answer to anyone.

I can do whatever I want,
And go wherever I please,
Without having to worry about someone else.

I can stay up all night
If I feel like it,
And sleep in late
If I don't feel like getting up.

I don't have to compromise
My beliefs or my values
To make someone else happy.

I can be myself
And nobody can tell me
That I'm doing it wrong.

So though some may see singleness
As a curse,
I see it as a special kind of bliss.
