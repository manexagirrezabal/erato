leness

Though many would say that singledom is a curse,
I couldn't disagree more. I love my life!
I'm not tied down by a relationship,
And I can come and go as I please.
I can go out with my friends and have fun,
And I don't have to worry about anyone else.
I don't have to deal with another person's moods,
And I don't have to listen to their complaints.
I can do whatever I want, when I want,
And I don't have to answer to anyone.
I'm free to be myself, and that's what I love most.
