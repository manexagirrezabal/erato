When I was younger I thought that love

I was something like a fairytale

I would find my prince and we would be together

Forever and always, just like in the movies

I was na√Øve and I had no idea

What love was really all about

I would have never guessed that it was pain

And that it would hurt so much to be without

Love is not a fairytale, it's not a dream

It's something that should be cherished and loved

But it's not always easy to find

And sometimes it's hard to be alone

I've come to realize that love is not for me

And that's okay, because I'm happy alone

I don't need someone to complete me

I'm content with the life I've chosen for myself

And I wouldn't want it any other way
