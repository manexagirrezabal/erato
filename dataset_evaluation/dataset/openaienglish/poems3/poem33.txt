Though many would have you believe,

That being single is a fate worse than death,

I could not disagree more with that belief.

For me, being single is a time of joy,

A time to focus on myself and my goals,

A time to enjoy the company of friends,

And a time to find new adventures.

Sure, it would be nice to be in a relationship,

But I am not about to let that fact

stop me from living a happy and fulfilling life.

So, to all of you who are single,

I say keep your head up high and

enjoy your time being single.
