leness

Though I am not alone, I often feel
As though I am the only one in the room
Who is without a partner, without a spouse
Without someone to share my life with.

It's not that I'm unhappy with my lot
But simply that I sometimes long for more
For someone to come home to at night
For someone to laugh with, and love

But I know that this is not my fate
That I am meant to be single and alone
And so I will keep on living my life
Filled with friends, family, and love.
