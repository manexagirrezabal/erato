leness



Alone I sit and ponder
What is life without a partner
I have friends and family
But I'm missing that one special person
Someone to share my life with
Someone to grow old with

I've been single for so long
I sometimes wonder if I'm doing something wrong
Is there something I'm not seeing
Or am I just not ready for love
I've had my share of heartache
And I don't want to go through that again

I sometimes think that being single
Is the best thing for me
I can do what I want
When I want
And I don't have to answer to anyone
But then I think of all the good things
That come with being in a relationship
And I can't help but wonder
If I'm missing out on something great
