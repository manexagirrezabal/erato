leness

Though I am not alone, I often feel as though
I am the only one in the world who is single.
It seems that everywhere I look, I see happy
couples, holding hands and gazing into each other's eyes.
It's easy to feel lonely and left out
when everyone around you is in a relationship
and you're the only one who is not.

But I am not alone, and I know that there are others
like me who are single and happy.
We are not lonely, because we are content
with our own company. We are not missing out,
because we are content with our own lives.

We are not alone, and we are not lonely.
We are happy and content, and we will
continue to be happy and content,
whether we are in a relationship or not.
