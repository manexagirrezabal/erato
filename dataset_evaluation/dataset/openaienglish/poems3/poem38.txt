leness

Though many would have us believe,

That being single is a fate worse than death,

I have found that being unattached

Is the best thing that has ever happened to me.

I am free to do as I please,

And I don't have to answer to anyone.

I can go where I want, when I want,

And I don't have to worry about anyone else.

I can focus on my own needs

And not have to worry about anyone else.

I am happy being single

And I wouldn't change it for the world.
