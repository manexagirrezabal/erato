leness



There is nothing quite like the feeling
Of being single and free
No obligations, no worries
Just living for the moment

There's a sense of joy and liberation
In being unattached and alone
It's like a breath of fresh air

You can do whatever you want
Whenever you want
And you don't have to answer to anyone

It's a wonderful feeling
Being single and free
And I wouldn't trade it for the world
