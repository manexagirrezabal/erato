 intelligence

As time goes on, more and more,
we rely on machines to think for us.
They're getting better and better at it,
too; in some ways, they're smarter than we are.
We create these artificial intelligences
and teach them how to learn and grow;
and then we step back and watch them thrive.
They become our helpers and our friends,
and often they know us better than we know ourselves.
They're always there for us when we need them,
and we couldn't be happier with them.
