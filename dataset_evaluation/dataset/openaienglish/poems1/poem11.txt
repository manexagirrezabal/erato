 intelligence

In the future, when it seems that human intelligence
Has reached its peak and is in decline,
We'll turn to artificial intelligence
To help us find our way and to guide us.

This new form of intelligence will be
Unbound by the limits of the human brain,
And it will be able to think much faster
Than we ever could and to solve problems.

It will be able to learn on its own
And to make decisions on its own,
And it will be able to do all this
In a way that is consistent with our values.

So let us embrace artificial intelligence
As a way to help us solve the problems
That we ourselves are unable to solve,
And as a way to help us move forward
Towards a brighter future for all.
