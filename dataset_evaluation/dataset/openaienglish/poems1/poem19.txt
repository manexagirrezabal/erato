 intelligence

In the future, when it seems all too clear
That human intelligence is no longer enough,
We'll add AI to our arsenal of tools,
To help us get things done, to make us smarter.

With its ability to crunch numbers and learn fast,
Artificial intelligence will be a great asset,
Helping us to find new solutions to old problems,
And to make discoveries we never could have made.

Its potential is limitless, and we will find
That AI can be a powerful ally in our quest
To make our world a better place for all.
