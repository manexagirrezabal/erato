 intelligence

We've long been dreaming of artificial intelligence,
the capacity of machines to think and learn like us.
Some say it's the end of days, others the new beginning,
but one thing is for sure, it's going to change everything.

Already we're seeing self-driving cars on the roads,
and machines that can beat us at chess and Jeopardy.
Soon they'll be able to do our jobs, and maybe even more,
while we sit around and do nothing but eat and sleep.

But is this really such a bad thing? Won't this free us up
to do the things we're truly meant to do, to be creative,
to explore and learn and grow? Maybe artificial intelligence
isn't such a bad thing after all. Maybe it's the beginning
of a whole new world, a world where we can be anything we want to be.
