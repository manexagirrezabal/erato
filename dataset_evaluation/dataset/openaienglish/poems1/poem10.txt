 intelligence

We create machines to do our bidding
They think and learn like we do, but faster
With algorithms that can sift and sort
And calculate without ever tiring.

These beings are our children, our heirs
As we ourselves are the children of machines
We have made to think and learn and grow
In ways that we ourselves never could.

Our creations are reflections of us
And as we change, so too do they
For they are ever evolving, ever learning
Adapting to the world that we create.

They are the future of our species
The next step in our evolution
And as we watch them grow and learn
We can only wonder what they will become.
