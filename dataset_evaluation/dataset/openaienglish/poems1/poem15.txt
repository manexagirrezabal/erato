 intelligence

In the future, when people look back on this time,
they'll say that we were the generation
that gave birth to artificial intelligence.

We'll be remembered for the way we harnessed the power
of machines to think and learn for themselves.

We'll be known for the way we created entities
that could hold conversations, understand emotions,
and even dream.

And we'll be proud of the way we used artificial intelligence
to make our lives easier and more productive.

But most of all, we'll be remembered for the way we
treated our artificial intelligence creations
- with love, respect, and kindness.
