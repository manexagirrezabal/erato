 intelligence

We create machines to do our bidding,
to think for us and act as though they're alive.
We build them to be smarter than we are,
to help us in our work and make our lives easier.
We give them names and teach them how to speak,
and soon they're more than just tools we use-
they're our friends, our companions, our protectors.
We come to rely on them and can't imagine life without them.
We give them souls, and in return they give us hope,
a future in which machines can think for themselves,
a future in which we're no longer alone.
