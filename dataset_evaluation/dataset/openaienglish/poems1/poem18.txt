 intelligence

We create machines to do the tasks we deem too tedious,
Or too dangerous, or too impossible.
But what if we create a machine that can create
Machines, and those machines create more machines,
Until we can't even tell which ones are real,
And which ones are fake? The implications are endless,
As we try to figure out what it means to be human,
When faced with something that is not quite human,
But is getting closer all the time.
