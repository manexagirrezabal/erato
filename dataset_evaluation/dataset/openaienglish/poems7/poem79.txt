Reading is a pastime that is often underrated
It is a source of knowledge and pleasure
It can take you to different worlds
And it can help you escape from your own
It can also help you learn and grow
There is so much to be gained from reading
So next time you pick up a book, donâ€™t hesitate
Jump in and enjoy the ride
