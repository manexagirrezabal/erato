Reading is a window to another world
A world of knowledge and understanding
A world of new ideas and possibilities
A world that can be explored at any time
A world that is always there for you

Reading can take you anywhere
Anywhere in the world
Anywhere in history
Anywhere in the future
It's a way to explore new ideas
And learn about other cultures
It's a way to escape the everyday
And explore new worlds

So take a break from the real world
And jump into a book
You'll be glad you did
And you'll be surprised at what you find
