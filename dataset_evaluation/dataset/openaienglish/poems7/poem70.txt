Reading is the way that we can all unite
In a single moment we can be in any place
With any person that we choose to be with
We can learn about things that we never knew before
And it only takes a moment for us to do it
All we need is a book and our willingness
To open our minds and let the words take us away
Into new and wonderful worlds that we never imagined
We can be anyone we want to be and go anywhere
All we need is a good book to take us there
