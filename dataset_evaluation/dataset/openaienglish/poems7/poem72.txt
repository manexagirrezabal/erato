Reading is a pastime that is often underrated

It is a way to escape the reality of the world

And to enter into the minds of great thinkers

It is a way to find new friends and to learn new things

It is a way to discover new passions and new talents

And it is a way to fall in love with new stories

Reading is a way to find yourself

And to explore the world around you

It is a way to learn and to grow

And it is a way to connect with others

So next time you pick up a book,

Remember that you are embarking on

A journey that will take you to new places

And will show you new things
