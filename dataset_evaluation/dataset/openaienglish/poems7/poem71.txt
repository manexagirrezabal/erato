How often do I pick up a book
And lose myself for hours in its pages?
How often do I find new ideas
Or feelings that I never knew I had?
Reading is a way to escape
From the world that's constantly pressuring us
It's a way to learn about other cultures
And to explore different worlds
It's a way to find new ideas
And to fall in love with new characters
It's a way to gain knowledge
And to grow as a person
Reading is a way to escape
From the world that's constantly pressuring us
And I'm so grateful for that escape
Thank you, books, for giving me a world
That's far away from the real world
