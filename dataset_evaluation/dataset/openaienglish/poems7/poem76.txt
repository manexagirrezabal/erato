To read is to journey into another realm,
A place where the impossible is possible,
And the everyday is magical.

To read is to open one's heart and mind,
To be swept away on a tide of imagination,
To discover new worlds and new ideas.

To read is to be transformed,
To become someone else for a little while,
To see the world through different eyes.

Reading is a joy, a privilege, and a treasure,
And I am grateful for every book I read,
For they have all helped to make me who I am.
