To ready is to prepare, to get ready.
It is to fix oneself up for something,
to put on one's armor for the day.

It is to ready oneself for the future,
to make sure that one is ready
for whatever comes.

To ready is to be vigilant,
to be prepared for anything.

It is to make sure that one is ready
for the challenges that life will bring.

To ready is to be strong,
to be ready for whatever comes.

It is to be ready for the journey
that lies ahead.
